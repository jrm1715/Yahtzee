TODO:

1. When the player selects a cell in one of the tables. Give the player the option to make that the players
  final choice and end their turn.
  *NOTE*: Created a function for when the player clicks a cell, the button text will change to say "End Turn". This will also change
  back to "Roll" when the player unselects that cell. If the player hits the roll button three times, the button text will change to "End Turn".
  *BUG* When the player hits Roll 3 times. The button text will change to "End Turn". If the player then selects a cell, and then unselects that cell, the button
  text will change back to "Roll".
